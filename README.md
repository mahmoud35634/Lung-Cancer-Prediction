# Lung Cancer Prediction

## Overview
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection is crucial for improving survival rates and treatment outcomes. This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify the likelihood of lung cancer using patient data. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can provide a tool that aids in the early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data normalization, and feature selection.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the data through statistical plots and charts.
Model Development: Implementing various machine learning algorithms to find the best predictive model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Deployment: Integrating the model into a web application for user-friendly predictions.

## Data
The dataset used for this project includes patient information such as age, gender, smoking history, genetic factors, and medical imaging results. The data has been collected from reputable medical databases and research studies.
